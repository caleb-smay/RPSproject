# Rock Paper Scissors Project -- CSCE 2110
## Caleb Smay, Zachary Jones, Daniel Kaderli


**Project Description**

The following code is provided to test the effectiveness of a number of different algorithms for Rock Paper Scissors. Each group member designed, tested, and collected data on two unique algorithms to determine their effectiveness. Following these tests, we chose a final algorithm to test against an unknown algorithm

In order to run the program, compile main.cpp, the remaining cpp files are largely for testing and debugging purposes
